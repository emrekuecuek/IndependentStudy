    QuickRet(;feature_thresholds::NTuple{4, Float64}, transformation_thresholds)

Constructs a QuickRet object. Contains `interface_hashtable`, `feature_thresholds` and `transformation_thresholds`.

QuickRet is a hashing algorithm for protein interfaces. Main point is to determine which cluster a certain given protein belongs to.

A protein consists of `atoms`. When certain atoms interacts and bonds to each other, they constitue a `residue`. A sequence of residues are called as a `chain`. A protein can contain one or more chains.

There are thousands of experimentally determined structures of proteins. Some of them contains a protein itself, some contain different proteins interacting. These interactions are similar in various ways, and in literature there are studies that clustered all interactions in order to prevent redundancy [10.1371/journal.pone.0086738](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0086738).

In [PIFACE](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0086738), there are clusters in order to prevent redundancy amongst protein interfaces. All of Protein-Protein Interactions (PPI) are clustered, thus redundancy is prevented. Each cluster has a `representative`, that represents the members of its cluster. A useful idea might be to check for similarities for an arbitrary protein with these clusters. Let's call this arbitrary protein as `query protein`. That way, we can determine the specifications of a query protein and investigate its properties, possible interaction candidates. This way, we can computationally calculate its binding properties or possible strong interactions much accurate.

Computational methods are by far faster, and knowing a certain proteins interaction candidates may lead more precise experimental results.

Moreover, cruciality of computational methods are undeniable. Template-based PPI Prediction methods are proven to be successful [1](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gku397), [2](https://doi.org/10.1038/nprot.2011.367). Though experimental methods are the most reliable methodologies for obtaining new information on a certain structure, computational methods can lead way to experimental methods since they can be done faster and produce bulk results. However, computational methods have a long way, they can be more faster, accurate.

`QuickRet` aims to decrease the calculation time of PPI's and remaining the accuracy same. As discussed above, template-based PPI prediction algorithms are successful. Template-based method means that to predict an interaction between two arbitrary protein ``P_a`` and ``P_b``, we can use another interaction let's say between ``P_c`` and ``P_d`` as a reference. By that, PRISM tries to dock ``P_a`` and ``P_b`` each other as if they are interacting similar like ``P_c`` and ``P_d``. But for an arbitrary interaction, it takes quite some time to calculate energy scores for each template. Considering the numbers of templates, finding the correct template takes a lot of time. QuickRet tries to reduce time to find possible templates by discarding the most irrelevant templates in a fast manner.

It contains two different steps. In the first step, algorithm deposits a representative interface from each non redundant protein clusters to a hash table. Clusters are obtained from [PIFACE [10.1371]](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0086738), a non-redundant template data base for protein protein interactions.

After constructing a hash table from the representatives of all clusters that taken from PIFACE, we can determine what a query protein is structurally similar to hashed clusters by looking the hash table. QuickRet is a fast algorithm, and the reason behind is it uses hash tables and compare proteins by the most little possible parts.

But first let's explain first phase of the algorithm. In the first step, algorithm takes representatives from each cluster. Then, it extracts a small part of it called `base`. A base consists of 4 atoms, 2 Carbon Alpha atoms (CA) and 2 Carbon Beta atoms (CB). CA atoms obtained from different residues between distance of 4 Angstrom to 13 Angstrom. CB atoms are obtained from those residues.

For a better understanding, let's call ``CA_1`` and ``CB_1`` as CA and CB atoms from first residue, and ``CA_2`` and ``CB_2`` for second residue. Algorithm creates a ``base`` from these four atoms, then calculates four `features`. These are:

- Distance between ``CA_1`` and ``CA_2``.
- Bond angle between ``CB_1``, ``CA_1``, ``CA_2``.
- Bond angle between ``CA_1``, ``CA_2``, ``CB_2``.
- Dihedral angle by all atoms.

These features will be `key`s for hash table with one addition. By using the `feature_thresholds` in the object, we will make integer division amongst all features. Hence, all features will be discretized. Then an item of `value` of the `interface_hashtable` will be a tuple, as (`base`, `interface id`) where `base` is a matrix with dimensions ``3x4``, each column is the coordinate of an atom going as ``CB_1``, ``CA_1``, ``CA_2``, ``CB_2``; and `interface id` is the id of the interface which `base` is extracted to. There will be many `base`s with same features (or keys) so all `base`s will create many lists under same `key`s. These can be from different interfaces or same interfaces, it does not matter.

This concludes first phase, hence the main cause and functionality of QuickRet structure. Calculation and insertion of hash table happens in `hash_template`. To reach second phase, see `create_score_list`.
